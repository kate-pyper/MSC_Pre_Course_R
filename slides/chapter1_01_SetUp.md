# Introduction

Notes: This section will walk you through how to install R and RStudio both on Windows machines and on Macs. Note that you will need to download and install both pieces of software! R is the underlying programming language that is being used, when I'm talking about installing R, I mean installing the software that can turn the programming language into some useful output. You don't need RStudio to run R code, however it does make things easier! RStudio is essentially a user interface, which makes programming in R a bit easier.

# Step 1: Installing R

All installations of R can be found on the [**C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/).

Once there, you chould locate the section called *Download and Install R*:
