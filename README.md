This is the source code for a pre-session R tutorial (still heavily under development!).

The site itself is built based on the framework created by <a href='https://ines.io/'>Ines Montani</a>, originally created for her [spaCy course](https://course.spacy.io).  The front-end is powered by
[Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org/) and [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) and the
back-end code execution uses [Binder](https://mybinder.org).

If you are interested in building a course on this framework, see Ines's starter repos for making courses in [Python](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-python) and [R](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-r), and her behind-the-scenes explanation of how the framework works at [the original course repo](https://github.com/ines/spacy-course#-faq).
